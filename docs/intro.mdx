import QueryBuilder from 'react-querybuilder'

## Installation

To install `react-querybuilder`, use npm or yarn.

```bash
# npm
npm i react-querybuilder

# Yarn
yarn add react-querybuilder
```

## Getting started

The simplest way to create a query builder is to render the QueryBuilder component with no props.

```tsx
import QueryBuilder from "react-querybuilder";

export const BasicExample = () => (
  <QueryBuilder />
);
```

That component will render this query builder:

<QueryBuilder />

Functional, but not really useful. To really get value out of the query builder, we'll first need to define a set of fields for the user to choose from.

```ts
import { Field } from "react-querybuilder";

const fields: Field[] = [
  { name: "firstName", label: "First Name" },
  { name: "lastName", label: "Last Name" },
];
```

We can pass the `fields` array into the query builder through the `fields` prop.

```tsx
import QueryBuilder from "react-querybuilder";

const FieldsExample = () => (
  <QueryBuilder fields={fields} />
);
```

That will render the query builder below. Click the "+Rule" button and then the fields selector to see the field choices.

<QueryBuilder fields={[{ name: "firstName", label: "First Name" },{ name: "lastName", label: "Last Name" }]} />

Much more useful, but you probably want to monitor and control what users do with the query builder. Let's set up a state variable using the React Hook `useState`. This will store our query object and allow us to pass it on to other components, event handlers, etc.

The state variable `query` will be passed to the `query` prop, and the setter method `setQuery` will be used in the `onQueryChange` callback. Let's also seed the query object with a couple of rules, making sure that the `field` property of each rule matches the `name` property of one of our fields.

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";
import QueryBuilder, { RuleGroupType } from "react-querybuilder";

const FirstUsefulExample = () => {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState<RuleGroupType>({
    combinator: 'and',
    rules: [
      { field: "firstName", operator: "=", value: "Steve" },
      { field: "lastName", operator: "=", value: "Vai" }
    ]
  });

  return (
    <QueryBuilder
      fields={fields}
      query={query}
      onQueryChange={(q) => setQuery(q)}
    />
  );
};
```

Which renders this:

<QueryBuilder
  fields={[
    { name: "firstName", label: "First Name" },
    { name: "lastName", label: "Last Name" }
  ]}
  query={{
    combinator: "and",
    rules: [
      { field: "firstName", operator: "=", value: "Steve" },
      { field: "lastName", operator: "=", value: "Vai" }
    ]
  }}
  onQueryChange={console.log}
/>
