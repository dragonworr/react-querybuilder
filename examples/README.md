## Examples

To quickly set up CodeSandbox using any of these examples as a template:

1. Navigate to the example folder (e.g. [basic-ts](./basic-ts/)) here on GitHub.
2. In the browser address bar, change the domain of the URL from `github.com` to `githubbox.com` (just add "box" after "github" and before ".com") and press Enter/Return.

You will be forwarded to [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io) with the example project preloaded.

## Development

To update and regenerate the examples (except for [ci](./ci/)), modify the [`_template` folder](./_template/) and run `yarn generate-examples` from the repo root directory.
