Renders a `<select>`. Used for all controls that allow the user to choose a value from a list:

- [`combinatorSelector`](./querybuilder#combinatorselector)
- [`fieldSelector`](./querybuilder#fieldselector)
- [`operatorSelector`](./querybuilder#operatorselector)
- [`valueSourceSelector`](./querybuilder#valuesourceselector)

`ValueSeletor` is also the default `selectorComponent` for [`ValueEditor`](./valueeditor), used when a rule's `value` must be selected from a list.
