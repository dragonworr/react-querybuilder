# Contributing

Contributions to `react-querybuilder` are more than welcome. When preparing to submit a pull request, please first discuss the change you wish to make by creating a [new issue](https://github.com/react-querybuilder/react-querybuilder/issues/new) or [discussion topic](https://github.com/react-querybuilder/react-querybuilder/discussions/new).

- If adding a new feature, be sure to add corresponding tests (we maintain 100% coverage).
- Ensure that your work didn't break anything.
- If changing behavior or adding a feature, submit a corresponding pull request for the [documentation site](https://github.com/react-querybuilder/react-querybuilder.github.io/).
- If applicable, update the TypeScript definitions.
- Run `yarn pretty-print` (which runs prettier) before committing.
- When solving a bug, please provide a reproducible example (we typically use [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io), but any interactive demonstration is fine). Feel free to use our [CI base](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/react-querybuilder/react-querybuilder/tree/HEAD/examples/ci) or [this simple template](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/react-querybuilder/react-querybuilder/tree/HEAD/examples/basic) ([JS version](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/react-querybuilder/react-querybuilder/tree/HEAD/examples/basic)) as a starting point.
