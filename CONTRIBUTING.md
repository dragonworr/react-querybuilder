# Contributing

Contributions to `react-querybuilder` and other associated packages are more than welcome. When preparing to submit a pull request, please first discuss the change you wish to make by creating a [new issue](https://github.com/react-querybuilder/react-querybuilder/issues/new) or [discussion topic](https://github.com/react-querybuilder/react-querybuilder/discussions/new).

- If adding a new feature, be sure to add corresponding tests since we maintain 100% coverage.
- If changing behavior or adding a feature, make sure the documentation is updated. You may need to update both the [current (aka "next") docs](./website/docs/) and the latest [versioned docs](./website/versioned_docs/).
- If applicable, update the TypeScript definitions in the [`@react-querybuilder/ts` package](./packages/ts/).
- If your editor doesn't automatically format code with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) when saving changes, run `bun pretty-print` (requires [Bun](https://bun.sh/)) before committing.
- When addressing a bug, please provide a reproducible example (we typically use [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io), but any interactive demo or example repo is fine). Feel free to use our [CI base](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/react-querybuilder/react-querybuilder/tree/main/examples/ci), the [basic template](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/react-querybuilder/react-querybuilder/tree/main/examples/basic-ts) ([JS version](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/react-querybuilder/react-querybuilder/tree/main/examples/basic)), or any of the other [examples](./examples/) as a starting point.
