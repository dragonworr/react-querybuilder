# Contributing

Contributions to `react-querybuilder` are more than welcome. When preparing to submit a pull request, please first discuss the change you wish to make by creating a [new issue](/react-querybuilder/react-querybuilder/issues/new) or [discussion topic](/react-querybuilder/react-querybuilder/discussions/new).

- If adding a new feature, be sure to add corresponding tests (we maintain 100% coverage).
- Ensure that your work didn't break anything.
- If changing behavior or adding a feature, update the [documentation site](/react-querybuilder/react-querybuilder.github.io/).
- If applicable, update the TypeScript definitions.
- Run `yarn pretty-print` (which runs prettier) before committing.
- When solving a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce it (CodeSandbox is great -- feel free to fork our [CI base](https://codesandbox.io/s/oq8ts) to get started).
