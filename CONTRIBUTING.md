# Contributing

Contributions to `react-querybuilder` are more than welcome. When preparing to submit a pull request, please first discuss the change you wish to make by creating a [new issue](https://github.com/react-querybuilder/react-querybuilder/issues/new) or [discussion topic](https://github.com/react-querybuilder/react-querybuilder/discussions/new).

- If adding a new feature, be sure to add corresponding tests since we maintain 100% coverage.
- Ensure that your work didn't break anything.
- If changing behavior or adding a feature, make sure the documentation is updated. You may need to update the [current (aka "next") docs](https://github.com/react-querybuilder/react-querybuilder/tree/main/website/docs) and the latest [versioned docs](https://github.com/react-querybuilder/react-querybuilder/tree/main/website/versioned_docs).
- If applicable, update the TypeScript definitions in the [`@react-querybuilder/ts` package](https://github.com/react-querybuilder/react-querybuilder/tree/main/packages/ts).
- Run `yarn pretty-print` (which runs [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)) before committing.
- When addressing a bug, please provide a reproducible example (we typically use [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io), but any interactive demo or example repo is fine). Feel free to use our [CI base](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/react-querybuilder/react-querybuilder/tree/main/examples/ci) or [this simple template](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/react-querybuilder/react-querybuilder/tree/main/examples/basic-ts) ([JS version](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/react-querybuilder/react-querybuilder/tree/main/examples/basic)) as a starting point.
